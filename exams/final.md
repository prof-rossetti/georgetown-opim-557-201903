# Final Exam

## Description

The final exam is designed to evaluate students' knowledge of technology concepts and VBA programming techniques.

The exam will be administered during the date and time designated by the registrar. It should likely take no more than 90 minutes to complete.

The exam will be administered in paper format, so students should remember to bring a pen or pencil.

## Contents

The exam will consist primarily of free-response questions, but may also contain multiple-choice and matching questions. Students will be asked to write VBA code to achieve some desired set of functionality specified by a business prompt.

All material from the course notes, slides, [exercises](/exercises), and projects is fair game. But especially likely to be included on the exam are any concepts discussed or practiced repeatedly throughout the course of the semester. The following concepts and techniques are of particular importance:

  + Displaying Textual Alert Messages ([Message Boxes](/notes/visual-basic/message-boxes.md))
  + Reading Values of Interface Elements ([ActiveX Controls](/notes/ms-excel/activex-controls/README.md))
  + Reading and Writing Cell Values (Working with [Ranges](/notes/ms-excel/ranges.md))
  + Discerning [Datatypes](/notes/visual-basic/datatypes.md)
  + Conditional Logic ([IF Statements](/notes/visual-basic/conditionals.md))
  + [Looping](/notes/visual-basic/loops.md)
  + Defining and Invoking [Custom Functions](/notes/visual-basic/functions.md)

## Submission Instructions

Each student should hand-in their exam booklet to the professor when finished.
